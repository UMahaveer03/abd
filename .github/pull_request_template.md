## Description

Created a complete automated bug hunting application with 4 comprehensive stages:

### 🔧 **Stage 1: Preparation**
- ✅ Target validation (domain/IP address)
- ✅ Environment and security tool checks
- ✅ Workspace setup and directory creation  
- ✅ Assessment scope definition
- ✅ Configuration management

### 🔍 **Stage 2: Reconnaissance**
- ✅ DNS enumeration (A, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME records)
- ✅ Multi-threaded subdomain discovery
- ✅ Port scanning with service detection
- ✅ Technology fingerprinting (web server, CMS, frameworks)
- ✅ HTTP information gathering
- ✅ SSL/TLS certificate analysis

### 🔍 **Stage 3: Vulnerability Identification**
- ✅ Web vulnerability scanning (XSS, SQLi, LFI, Directory Traversal)
- ✅ SSL/TLS vulnerability assessment
- ✅ Service-specific vulnerability checks
- ✅ Security misconfiguration detection
- ✅ Sensitive file exposure testing
- ✅ Security header analysis

### 💥 **Stage 4: Exploitation**
- ✅ Safe proof-of-concept development
- ✅ Automated exploitation attempts
- ✅ Risk assessment and categorization
- ✅ Multi-format reporting (JSON, HTML, Executive Summary)
- ✅ Detailed security recommendations
- ✅ Remediation guidance

## Key Features

- **Professional Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Safety First**: Non-destructive testing with proper rate limiting
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: JSON, HTML, and executive summary reports
- **Multi-threading**: Optimized performance for large-scale assessments
- **Configurable**: Extensive configuration options via JSON config
- **Command Line Interface**: Full CLI with help and stage-specific execution
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging with colored output
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful failure management

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Python 3.7+ with professional security libraries
- **Dependencies**: requests, dnspython, beautifulsoup4, colorama, tabulate
- **Threading**: Concurrent subdomain enumeration and port scanning  
- **Safety**: Rate limiting, WAF detection, non-destructive payloads
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-ready architecture for future enhancements

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Complete assessment
python3 abd.py -t example.com

# Single stage execution
python3 abd.py -t example.com --stage preparation

# Custom configuration
python3 abd.py -t example.com -c config.json -v
```

This transforms the minimal subdomain takeover repository into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade automated bug hunting platform suitable for security professionals and organizations.
